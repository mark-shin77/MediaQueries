                <p>Hello! My name is Mark. Thank you for taking the time to visit my site!</p>
                <p>For the past 2 years I have been helping out at my family's business through some tough times. For along time I felt stuck and unsure of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be in life.
                After spending long hours debating over the answer to that question. I came to release how passionate I am about the tech industry. Which is when I learned about coding, not so much what is but how it is done and the behind-the-scenes work needed in order to make everyday things work and function properly. </p>
                <p>Eventually I am hoping to use this bootcamp as a way doorway into the gaming industry!</p>
